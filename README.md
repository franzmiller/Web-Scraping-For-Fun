# Web-Scraping-For-Fun
Learning and playing with web scraping with BeautifulSoup on two simple, local websites. 
I may add frontends, notifications, or other features in the future. 

Warning:  Using this code, like any web-scraping, should be done with caution and respect to the websites being scraped. 
          Before scraping a website, review the robots.txt file and Terms of Service (ToS).
          Do not overload the servers with requests. This could potentially DDOS site, causing potential legal issues and/or loss of access to the website.
          Review your code and execution CAREFULLY to not send too many requests.
